# ZK Basics Cheatsheet

After [Monero Addresses Cheatsheet](https://github.com/baro77/MoneroAddressesCS), [Rings Cheatsheet](https://github.com/baro77/RingsCS) and [Monero RingCT Cheatsheet](https://github.com/baro77/RctCS) the intention was to write the next one about Bulletproof (the "_to be continued..._" of the third infographic).
However very soon it has been clear that **Zero Knowledge Proofs theory** is mandatory to have a comprehensive understanding about how BP works (apart from being a very interesting field by itself,laying foundations for many cool techs): so here it is the [present poster](https://github.com/baro77/ZKbasicsCS/blob/main/ZKbasicsCheatsheet20220621.pdf).

I have tried to not miss the basic core concepts despite the simplified approach and topics selection, stressing ideas more than formalism: the merit of this cheatsheet, if any, is trying to represent an at-hand, concise, first bridge between theoretical foundations and applications developers approaching this world (not necessarily cryptography professionals). Of course this kind of resource cannot be a rigorous reference, but authoritative sources that I have consulted are listed, to let the interested reader dig deeper: definitely not an easy task, but worth the study these books require.
